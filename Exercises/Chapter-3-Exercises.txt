1.  What is the main benefit of using an external style rather than embedded style sheets?
	a. I can't pick one main benefit.  Easier to maintain.  Reusable.  Quicker page loads with styles separate.
	ANSWER: Can be aplied to the entire site.

2. Write a CSS rule that chagnes the appearance of all headings at level one (h1) in your page to the following:
	2.1 The heading uses an Arial font face.
	2.2 The heading should be blue.
	2.3 The heading must have a font size of 18 pixels.
	2.4 The heading has a blue, thin border at the top and left side.
		a. h1 {
				border-top: 1px blue solid;
				border-right: none;
				border-bottom: none;
				border-left: 1px blue solid;
				color: blue;
				font-family: Arial;
				font-size: 18px;
			}
		ANSWER: Good but border right and bottom are redundant.

3. Which of the two following rules is easier to reuse across pages in your website?  Can you explain why?
	3.1 #MainContent { border: 1px solid Blue; }
	3.2 .BoxWithBorders { border: 1px solid Blue; }
	2 is easier to reuse because it is a class not an ID, this means it can be reused multiple times on the same page.  It's name is also more descriptive letting people know at a glance what it is for.
	ANSWER: 2 because of class.  Doesn't mention anything about better naming conventions.

4. VS enables you to attach an external style sheet to a page in a number of differnt ways.  Can you name two differnt ways to do this?
	If it already exists you can drag in from the Solution Explorer on to the page.
	Or you can be a proper developer and write it in yourself. (Touchy much!)
	ANSWER: Type it in the code.  Drag from Solution Explorer into head in Markup mode.  Drap from Solution Explorer onto page in design mode.

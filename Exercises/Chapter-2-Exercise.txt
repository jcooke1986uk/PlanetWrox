	ANSWER: .aspx files. .css files. .html files. .config files.
2. What do you need to do to make a piece of text both bold and italicized in your web page? What will the resulting HTML look like?
	a. Use Formatting and press B and I or code it and use <strong></strong> and <em></em> in either order. <strong><em>Bold italic text</em></strong>
	ANSWER: Correct, but didn't mention if using the formatting toolbar to select the text first; I just thought that was too obvious to mention.
3. Name three differnt ways to add existing files to an ASP.NET website in VS.
	a. Drag and drop them in. Right click and Add Existing Item.  Top menu, Website > Existing Item.
	ANSWER: Correct but I didn't mention that the first two relate to the Solution Explorer.
4. What are the different views that VS offers you for your ASPX pages?  Does VS offer other views as well?
	a. Design, Source and a Mix of both.  Probably offers more but it's already got two more than I need.
	ANSWER: Correct but Mix is called Split View.  Code Behind files also offer Code Behind View.  I'm not convinced on that, code behind view is just source/code view - I feel conned.

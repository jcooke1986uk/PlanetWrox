1.  Name the machanism that enables server controls to maintain their state.
	a. The State Engine
	ANSWER: Apparently it's the View State (I don't get why it's not the State Engine)

2. How is the ASP.NET run time able to keep track of control state between postbacks?
	a. The information is placed in the hidden field VIEWSTATE, posted to the server and sent back from the server.
	ANSWER: Good but keep in mind that it's _VIEWSTATE with a leading underscore.

3.  Name a difference between an <asp:DropDownList> and an <asp:ListBox>
	a.  Not too sure so I'll take a guess.  The ListBox is HTML based so will produce a <select> and can only have its list contents hand coded rather than done throught the wizard/box thing.
	ANSWER: ListBox is multiselect and is capable of displaying all items at once.  Dropdown is one item at a time and single select

4. What property do you need to cause a postback to the server when you change the checked state of a CheckBox in the browser?
	a. CheckBox.Change
	ANSWER: Autopostback needs to equal True

5. Many server controls have a common set of properties that affects their looks at run time.  Name three properties that change styling elements such as color, borders, and size.
	a. Wouldn't know as I use CSS.
	ANSWER: BackColor ForeColor BorderColor BorderStyle BorderWidth

6. Instead of setting individual control properties like BackColor and ForeColor, it's better to set a single CSS-related property.  What's the name of this property and what benefit does it give you?
	a. Don't understand the question.
	ANSWER: CssClass property to set a class name which can be used in an external CSS file.
